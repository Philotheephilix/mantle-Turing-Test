/**
 * @title CounterGameSystem
 * @notice A minimal turn-based reference game. Each player, on their turn,
 *         increments a shared room counter by 1; the player who pushes the value
 *         to `target` wins. Exercises the full World + System._msgSender +
 *         TurnManager loop end to end on a real EVM.
 *
 * @dev    The on-turn check here mirrors what the TurnBoundEnforcer enforces at
 *         redemption: the system independently asserts the mover is the current
 *         player, so the game is safe even on the direct (non-redemption) path.

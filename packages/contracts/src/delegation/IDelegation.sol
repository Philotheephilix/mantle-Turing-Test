/**
 * @title Nexus minimal ERC-7710 delegation interfaces
 * @notice These are MINIMAL LOCAL interfaces that match the MetaMask Delegation
 *         Framework (ERC-7710) signatures. We define them locally rather than
 *         vendoring the full framework so the package compiles deterministically
 *         and stays Base-only and small. They are *signature-compatible* with the
 *         canonical framework: enforcers written against `ICaveatEnforcer` here
 *         are callable by a framework-style manager.
 *
 * @dev    LIVE INTEGRATION NOTE:
 *         Nexus ships its OWN ERC-7710-style `NexusDelegationManager` (a real
 *         on-chain manager, NOT a mock). These interfaces are signature-compatible
 *         with MetaMask's framework, but Nexus deploys and uses its own manager
 *         with its own EIP-712 domain ("Nexus Game Delegation", version "1").
 *         There is no dependency on a canonical MetaMask deployment at runtime: the
 *         manager address is whatever `NexusDelegationManager` is deployed to and
 *         is wired into the World via `World.setTrustedForwarder(manager)`.

/**
 * @title Pot
 * @notice A simple, trustless USDC escrow per roomId. Players deposit entry fees;
 *         on settle the winner is paid the balance minus a rake (bps) credited to
 *         the rake collector. Settlement is admin-keyless: only the registered
 *         settle authority (the World / a registered settle system) may call it.
 *
 * @dev    TRUST MODEL: `settleAuthority` is the single point of control over fund
 *         destination. `settle` only checks that `winner` actually deposited
 *         (no paying a non-participant); it does NOT and cannot verify the game's
 *         win condition on-chain — that lives in the settle system that calls here.
 *         Whoever can trigger that system controls where the pot goes, so the
 *         settle authority must be gated as tightly as the caveat-enforcer layer.
 *         There is no owner key and no upgrade path; the rake is bounded at
 *         construction (`rakeBps <= 10_000`).

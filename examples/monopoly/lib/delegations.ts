/**
 * Browser-safe delegation signing. Pure @nexus/core + viem — no relayer key, no
 * fs. Used by BOTH the browser (the human signs with the guest wallet) and the
 * server-side bots (each bot signs with its own key). The relayer is the delegate
 * (the redeemer); the signer is the delegator (the PLAYER).
 *
 * Mirrors examples/uno/lib/delegations.ts exactly. THIS is the correct pattern:
 * each player signs its OWN gameplay + budget delegation with its OWN key.

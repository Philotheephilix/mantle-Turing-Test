/**
 * SERVER-ONLY in-process MONOPOLY driver.
 *
 * Ported from scripts/bots.ts, but it calls the game-backend functions DIRECTLY
 * (no HTTP) since it runs inside the same Next.js Node process as the singleton.
 * Each bot signs its OWN gameplay + budget delegations once with its OWN key, pays
 * the buy-in via game-backend.join, then loops: on its turn it decides a legal move
 * (lib/bot-strategy) and submits it via game-backend.act. Stops when state.winner is
 * set. Robust try/catch around each action (the engine retries on-chain).
 *
 * HUMAN AUTO-PILOT: the human seat is normally driven by the browser UI (roll → buy
 * → end). To guarantee the game ALWAYS progresses to a winner — even if the browser
 * is slow or a multi-step modal stalls — the runner also watches the human seat: if
 * it's the human's turn, the human has PAID, and the human has been idle past a grace
 * window, the backend plays ONE legal human action itself (roll/buy/end). This keeps
 * the on-chain full game flowing without the test having to perfectly click through
 * every modal. The human's own browser clicks still take effect first when they land.
 *
 * NEVER import from a client component (it pulls in the relayer engine).

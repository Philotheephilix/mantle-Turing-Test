/**
 * The authoritative, full-rules UNO game state machine (server-side). Holds the
 * deck, every player's hand, the discard pile, direction, active color, and the
 * turn cursor. Validates EVERY play against the official rules and applies action
 * effects (Skip / Reverse / Draw Two / Wild / Wild Draw Four), reshuffles the
 * discard into the draw pile when empty, and detects the real win (a player
 * legally playing their last card).
 *
 * This module is deck/turn logic only — it knows nothing about the chain. The
 * server (scripts/server.ts) seeds the deck order from an ON-CHAIN random word,
 * seals each hand with @steamlink/secrets, mirrors each legal move on-chain through
 * the player's gameplay delegation, and settles the pot on the real win.

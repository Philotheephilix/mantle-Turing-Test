/**
 * The REAL, official UNO rules engine for Nexus UNO — a pure, deterministic
 * module shared by the authoritative backend (scripts/server.ts) and the bots.
 *
 * This is the full 108-card deck and the complete official ruleset. No
 * shortcuts, no "all cards are wild", no fake fast-win. Hands are private; this
 * module only decides legality, deck composition, and action effects — the
 * authoritative game STATE (whose hand holds what, the deck order) lives in the
 * server, seeded by an ON-CHAIN random word (see lib/shuffle.ts).
 *
 * Card model (compact, integer-only so it round-trips on-chain cleanly):
 *   color : 0 = wild (black), 1 = red, 2 = green, 3 = blue, 4 = yellow
 *   value : 0..9          → number card
 *           SKIP / REVERSE / DRAW_TWO        → colored action card
 *           WILD / WILD_DRAW_FOUR            → wild action card (color = 0)
 *
 * The on-chain UnoGameSystem records the real card played as (color, value),
 * enforces turn order, and emits the win — see contracts/UnoGameSystem.sol.

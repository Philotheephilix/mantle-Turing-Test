# SteamLink

**Fully onchain, turn-based games on Base — one signature, then every move is gasless and every
payment is bounded on-chain.** SteamLink is a game-engine SDK (engine name: *Nexus*). A player signs
**one** ERC-7710 delegation when they join a room; a relayer redeems that single signature for
everything after — gasless moves (no wallet popups) and x402 stablecoin payments capped on-chain by
caveats. You describe a game as **data** (tables) and **logic** (Solidity systems); the SDK handles
the cryptography, relaying, randomness, sealed state, and settlement.

Live on Base Sepolia with real transactions; the architecture is mainnet-ready.

---

## What you get

- **One delegation → infinite gasless moves.** The player signs once at join. The relayer submits
  every `redeemDelegations` call and pays gas; the player pays zero gas and signs nothing again.
- **x402 payments with on-chain guardrails.** Entry fees and in-game charges are real USDC transfers
  bounded by the delegation's per-action + lifetime caps — the relayer can never overspend a player.
- **Typed end to end.** A misspelled table fails at compile time; game logic is real Solidity, never
  interpreted in JS.
- **Two wallet rails.** A built-in session/embedded wallet (zero setup), or a real **MetaMask Smart
  Account** that authorizes spend through MetaMask's native ERC-7715 permission popup.
- **Provable + private.** Onchain randomness for shuffles/dice; sealed hidden state (hands,
  fog-of-war) revealed only to its owner.

## How it works in one example — `define`, `move`, `monetize`

```ts
// 1) DEFINE — your game is data (tables) + logic (Solidity systems).
import { defineGame, t } from "@steamlink/core";

export const game = defineGame({
  name: "tic-tac-toe",
  tables: {
    Board: { roomId: t.uint256, cells: t.bytes, turn: t.address },
  },
  systems: {
    PlayMove: "src/systems/PlayMove.sol", // real Solidity — never interpreted in JS
  },
  economy: {
    entryFee: { amount: "1.00", token: "USDC" },
    pot: { type: "winner-take-all", rake: "0.05" },
  },
});
```

```tsx
// 2) MOVE — the player signs ONE delegation at join; every move after is gasless,
//    no popup. `move` redeems that delegation through the relayer, applies an
//    optimistic update, and reconciles on the on-chain result.
import { useGameActions, useTable } from "@steamlink/react";

function PlayMoveButton({ roomId, cell }: { roomId: bigint; cell: number }) {
  const { move, isPending } = useGameActions();
  const { data: board } = useTable("Board", { roomId }); // live, optimistic
  return (
    <button
      disabled={isPending}
      onClick={() => move("PlayMove", { roomId, cell })} // gasless redemption
    >
      Play cell {cell}
    </button>
  );
}
```

```ts
// 3) MONETIZE — put an x402 paywall on any endpoint. The charge settles as a real
//    USDC transfer to your Pot, bounded by the player's budget caveats — no popup,
//    no gas for the player.
import express from "express";
import { monetize } from "@steamlink/server";

const app = express();
app.post(
  "/api/premium-hint",
  monetize({ price: "0.10", token: "USDC", chain: "base", recipient: POT_ADDRESS, facilitator: "nexus" }),
  (req, res) => res.json({ hint: "play the center", settlement: req.settlement }),
);
```

That's the whole surface: **`defineGame`** declares the game, **`move`** redeems the single
delegation for a gasless action, **`monetize`** charges bounded USDC over x402.

## Run a reference game locally

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm --filter @nexus/example-uno dev   # http://localhost:3100 — boots the game + bots, plays itself
```

Open the URL, connect a wallet, and play. The app auto-seats a table against bots; you sign one
delegation and every move + payment settles on-chain, gaslessly.
